#OpenCV C++ Motion Detection

This is a free, open, motion detection project using OpenCV and C++. The project was orginally designed for [the Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/). Due to the low CPU power and available memory, the algorithm of Collins et al. is used. More information about how it works can [be found here](http://blog.cedric.ws/opencv-simple-motion-detection).

The project includes 4 different parts:

* The source of the motion detection, using a simple rectangle where motion is detected.
* A commandline tool, selectregion, to select a region of interest on a selected image.
* The source of the motion detection, using a complex concave hull (this area is generated by the selectregion tool).
* A webinterface to view and filter the images in your webbrowser.
